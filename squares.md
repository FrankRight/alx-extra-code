# Algorithm of sum of square numbers

Step 1: Read N.

Step 2 : Let count = 0, sum = 0.

Step 3: Read Num.

Step 4 : count = count + 1.

Step 5: Compute the square of the number i.e., = sqr (Num \* Num).

Step 6 : sum = sum \* sqr.

Step 7: If ctr is less than N then repeat steps 3 to 6.

Step 8: Print sum.
